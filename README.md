# WPF_App_1

This is a test project to get familar with using WPF and SQLite inside of VS2015.  

The goal of the project is to create a program that requires users to login, and the provides them with a dashboard
of a couple data tables from the self contained SQLite database.  

This is also an exploration into using Git for software development from multiple computers (i.e. office and home). 
All of my previous projects have been from a single computer where I haven't had a need to pull down code.
